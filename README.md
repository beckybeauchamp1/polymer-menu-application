# Menu Polymer App (Financial Education)

This is the start of a polymer application for helping users get educated on various financial topics including credit, retirement, and access to financial news headlines. This is a small menu/top navigation bar that has routing implemented. I also added a news feed using newsapi.org to test out using an additional external API. The start of this application and file structure was generated/created using polymer cli.
